This is first my first app i ever wrote from "sratch" after three months of learning Python as a Data Scientist not Programmer.
If you want to learn new language or improve your current skills this is the right place, because this app is called language helper!
Say hi to the future and learn with AI!

All you need to acces this app is pass your OpenAI API key and... that's all, enjoy!
You can find this app under this link: https://pomagaczjezykowy.streamlit.app/

NOTE:
In near future i want to rebuild this app and change tech stack.
I want to build it from scratch again but in FastAPI and use all of my knowledge I gathered in last months,
like JS, HTML, CSS and much improved Python. 
This app is fine but too simple, I learned a lot so I want to check myself that's why I'm gonna do that.
